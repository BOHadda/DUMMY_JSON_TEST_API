In this project, I utilized **Postman** for implementing the APIs and conducting their tests. Additionally, I used **Newman** commands for executing the tests and generating **HTML Extra reports** to analyze the results. The project includes the following collections:

***Authentication**

***Users**

***Posts**

***Products**

These collections contain a series of API tests aimed at validating various features of the Dummy JSON API.
